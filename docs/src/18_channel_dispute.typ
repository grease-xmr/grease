== Channel Dispute

In the event of a dispute, such as when one peer becomes unresponsive or attempts to close the channel with an outdated state, the aggrieved
peer initiates a force-close procedure. This process leverages the KES to ensure fair resolution and allows the wronged peer to reclaim
funds according to the latest agreed channel state.

The dispute process is described in detail in @forceClose.

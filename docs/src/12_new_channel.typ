== New Channel

A new channel is established when a Merchant shares some initialization data with a Customer
out-of-band.

The customer takes this data, combines it with their own information, and sends a channel proposal to the Merchant.

There are *three* half-rounds of communication in this phase#footnote([See `server.rs:customer_establish_new_channel`]):

1. Out-of-band channel initialization data (CID) sharing from Merchant to Customer:
    - Contact information for the merchant
    - Channel seed metadata. This includes metadata so that both merchant and customer can uniquely identify the
      channel throughout the channel's lifetime. This includes:
        - an id for the channel
        - The merchant's closing address
        - The requested initial balances
        - The merchant's id
    - Protocol-specific initialization data. This might include commitments for parameters that will be shared later,
      the KES public keys that can be accepted, etc.
